# 🧠 Build a CNN From Scratch in C++ 98.19 accuracy

> A complete Convolutional Neural Network implemented entirely from scratch in modern C++.

❌ No data augmentation
❌ No TensorFlow
❌ No PyTorch
❌ No OpenCV
❌ No ML libraries
❌ No GPU acceleration (CPU only)

✅ Just C++, mathematics, and a deep understanding of how neural networks actually work.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Modern deep learning frameworks make neural networks look simple.

A few lines of code can create a model, train it, and achieve impressive results.

But behind that simplicity lies a tremendous amount of engineering:

- 🧩 Tensor systems
- 🔄 Forward propagation
- ⬅️ Backpropagation
- 🧮 Gradient computation
- 🖼️ Image decoding
- ⚡ Optimizers
- 📊 Training pipelines
- 💾 Model serialization

This project exists to **open the black box**.

Instead of using a framework, we build one.

Every major component is implemented manually in C++ so you can understand exactly what happens behind the scenes.
